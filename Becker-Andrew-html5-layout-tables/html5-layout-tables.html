The team is a member of the American Football Conference's North Division and current defending champions of the National Football League.					</p>					<p>						The team originated in 1996 when then-owner of the Cleveland Browns, Art Modell, announced his plans to relocate the franchise to Baltimore.[2] As part of a settlement between the league and the city of Cleveland, Modell was required to leave the Browns' name, colors and heritage in Cleveland for a replacement team that took the field in 1999. In return, he was allowed to take his players to Baltimore, where his new team would be legally recognized as an expansion team. The team's name was inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's poem The Raven, as Poe lived for a time in Baltimore, died and was buried there in 1849.					</p>				</article>				<a href="#top">Top</a>								<header>					<h2 id="rival">Rivalries</h2>				</header>				<article>					<p>						By far the team's biggest rival is the Pittsburgh Steelers. Pittsburgh and Baltimore are separated by a less-than-five-hour drive along Interstate 70. Both teams are known for their hard-hitting physical style of play. They play at least twice a year in the AFC North, and have met three times in the playoffs. Games between these two teams usually come down to the wire. The rivalry is considered one of the most significant and intense in the NFL today.					</p>				</article>				<a href="#top">Top</a>								<header>					<h2 id="season">2013 Season Completed Games</h2>				</header>				<table>					<tr>						<th>Opponent</th>						<th>Location</th>						<th>Score</th>					</tr>					<tr>						<td>Denver Broncos</td>						<td>Denver</td>						<td class = "lose">L 27-49</td>					</tr>					<tr>						<td>Cleveland Browns</td>						<td>Baltimore</td>						<td class = "win">W 6-14</td>					</tr>				</table>			</div>						<div id="col2">				<aside>					<header>						<h2 id="superbowl">Super Bowl wins</h2>					</header>						<ol>							<li>2000 (XXXV)</li>							<li>2012 (XLVII)</li>						</ol>				</aside>			</div>						<footer>				<p>Resource <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens">Wikipedia-Baltimore Ravens</a>				</p>			</footer>		</div>	</body></html>
